# The effect of Epsilon of the result:
First, when Epsilon is very large (Greater than 1), the program freezes and cannot solve the puzzle
Second, for Epsilon greater than 0.47 (I tried 0.48, 0.5, 0.8, and 1), the path starts by moving right
Third, for Epsilon less than 0.47 (I tried 0.47, 0.3, and 0.1), the path starts by moving up
Finally, I observed that the greater Epsilon is, the less the utility of the path is. For example, when Epsilon is 0.2, the utility of the path is 2941.318 while the utility of the path is equal to 2749.739 when Epsilon is equal to 0.8
